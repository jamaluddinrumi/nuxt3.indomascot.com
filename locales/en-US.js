  whatIsMascotCostume: "What is a mascot costume?",
  accordingToWikipedia:
    "According to WikiPedia, a mascot clown costume is a costume made by a company to make their mascot/company logo real to the public. These costumes are often used for brand socialization, company promotions, exhibitions, or increasing a team's brand awareness in a sporting event. Because it will be used by humans, the design must adjust the proportions of the human body.",
  whatIsTheDifferent: "How is it different from a clown suit?",
  itsJustTheSame:
    "Just the same. It's just the name sometimes nowadays people prefer to call it a clown suit or a clown costume. This clown suit is all-size, which means that it is proportionally worn by adults whose height is generally 170-190cm. For the design, it can also be taken from the mascot doll which is first adjusted to the proportions of the human body.",
